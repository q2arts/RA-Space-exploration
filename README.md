 **AI-Powered VR/AR Training and Simulation System for Space Tourists**

## About the Project

The proposed solution leverages state-of-the-art virtual and augmented reality technologies combined with AI to create a fully immersive training environment. This system simulates every phase of the space tourism experience, offering a cutting-edge approach to preparing space tourists for the realities of space travel. The key components include an immersive VR environment, augmented reality overlays, and AI-powered personalization.

## Development Requirements

- Game engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine for developing VR/AR client applications.
- Advanced physics engines for realistic spaceflight simulation.
- AR glasses or head-up displays for real-time information overlay.
- AI algorithms for adaptive training modules and simulated emergency scenarios.
- Cloud services for real-time data processing and scalable storage.

## Dev Installation Guidelines

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aimtyaem/RA-Space-exploration.git
   cd RA-Space-exploration
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Follow the specific setup instructions provided in the `README` or `INSTALL` files within the repository to install necessary dependencies for the VR/AR client application.
   - Ensure that the required game engines (Unity or Unreal Engine) and physics engines are installed and configured.

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Launch the VR/AR client application using the respective game engine's development environment.
   - Connect the application to the backend services (AI engine, CMS, cloud integration) as specified in the system architecture.
